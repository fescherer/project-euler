<p>Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
</p>

<p>
  <strong>1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</strong>
</p>

<p>By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.</p>

  ```
    limit = 4000000

    x = 1
    y = 1
    z = 0
    result = 0

    while z < limit:

        z = x + y
        if(z % 2 == 0):
            result = result + z

        x = y
        y = z

    print(result)
  ```
